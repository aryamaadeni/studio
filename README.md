# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

1.  Push your code to the `main` branch of your `<username>/<username>.github.io` repository.
2.  The GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically build the static site.
3.  The action will then push the contents of the `out` directory to the `main` branch, making your site live.
